# Accessibility

Making commerce better for everyone means caring deeply about making quality products. A quality product should have a fantastic user experience (UX), including:

* A beautiful and functional design
* Consistent and useful copy
* Principles of universal design and inclusivity

## Usable for everyone

It’s important that Shopify products—and Partner products—are usable and useful to everyone.

“Everyone” is a pretty big group. It includes our merchants, their customers, our developer partners, our employees, and the greater tech community at large.

“Everyone” also includes:

* 9.1% of adults with vision trouble [Source: Disability and Functioning, CDC], and 8% of men and 0.5% of women who are color blind [Source: Color Blind Awareness]
* 16.8% of adults with hearing trouble [Source: Disability and Functioning, CDC]
* 15.1% of adults with physical functioning difficulty [Source: Disability and Functioning, CDC]
* 4.4% of adults with cognitive disabilities [Source: 2016 Disability Statistics Annual Report (PDF)]

## Building inclusive experiences

Using our re-usable components is a way to improve accessibility and consistency when building products for Shopify.

* The component library in this style guide includes component code we can use across applications
* This component code includes accessible markup
* Since the code exists in a single component that gets reused, it’s easier to update and fix any bugs

The build-it-once, use-it-everywhere model means the accessibility knowledge of the developers who build these components is now available to all of Shopify and our Partners. This way our users get a consistent, accessible experience, each and every time.

### ALTERNATIVE TEXT

Our components use alternative text for icons, complex images, and actions (like buttons and links) to help people with low or loss of vision use our products.

### FEEDBACK

Sometimes building accessible and inclusive experiences can be hard. If we’ve made any mistakes in this style guide, please reach out by creating a GitHub issue and help us make it better!
